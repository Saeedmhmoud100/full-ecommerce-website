		    		 <br>

		    		 <p>
		    		 	In an effort to deliver the next generation of what Apple CEO Tim Cook called "the most-loved phone in the world," the iPhone 6S has created the next generation of its industry-shattering multitouch screen: the 3D Touch, which Chief Design Officer Jony Ive called "a tremendous breakthrough in interacting with our devices" in the company's demo video.
		    		 	<br><br>

		    		 	Deemed "a whole new dimension to the way you experience your iPhone" by Apple, 3D Touch recognizes a user's wanted action via finger pressure and force, rather than a mere gesture like the traditional swipe or pinch.
		    		 	<br><br>

		    		 	But how exactly does this work? The explanation is somewhat simple, even if the technology is more extensive than meets the eye. To wit: sensors within the smartphone measure the force of finger pressure, which then translates, letting the iPhone know the users needs and wants.
		    		 	<br><br>

		    		 	For example, if a user applies a light pressure to the screen when selecting an option to view content, the preview for said content pops up; if the user presses harder on the option for the content, it will open automatically.
		    		 	<br><br>

		    		 	Apple's Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, who conducted a live demo at the Apple event, also demonstrated how the new interactive interface eliminates going "in and out" of windows in certain apps, like mail apps â€“ with 3D Touch, pressure dictates whether the user wants a sneak peek of a message, or to fully view it.
